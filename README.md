# arduino-traffic-light
this is a traffic ligh with arduino, it's free.
for this sketch i am using the 5, 6 and 7 pins to connect the leds which you can easly change it from the code.
connect resistor of 220ohm for each pin whic you selcted then connect the positve pin for each led to each resistor.
finaly collect the groung of all leds to the ground of the arduino.
